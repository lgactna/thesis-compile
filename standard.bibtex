	abstract = {Cyber forensics has encountered major obstacles over the last decade and is at a crossroads. This paper presents data that was obtained during the National Workshop on Redefining Cyber Forensics (NWRCF) on May 23-24, 2017 supported by the National Science Foundation and organized by the University of New Haven. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed from twenty-four cyber forensics expert panel members. This work identified important themes that need to be addressed by the community, focusing on (1) where the domain currently is; (2) where it needs to go and; (3) steps needed to improve it. Furthermore, based on the results, we articulate (1) the biggest anticipated challenges the domain will face in the next five years; (2) the most important cyber forensics research opportunities in the next five years and; (3) the most important job-ready skills that need to be addressed by higher education curricula over the next five years. Lastly, we present the key issues and recommendations deliberated by the expert panel. Overall results indicated that a more active and coherent group needs to be formed in the cyber forensics community, with opportunities for continuous reassessment and improvement processes in place.},

	abstract = {Realistic case studies are essential to training successful digital forensics examiners. However, the generation of realistic datasets is time-consuming and resource taxing. This paper presents a technical solution that populates Android emulators with realistic mobile forensic data. The emulator's data can be extracted into a raw disk image that is usable in mobile forensic training scenarios. In addition, the tool allows a user to populate the Android emulators with custom text messages, phone contacts, phone calls, and files. This population task is achieved by utilizing the Android Debug Bridge, Android Content Providers, SQLite databases, and the NodeJS runtime environment. This paper presents the software design and development, the requirements and limitations, and the testing process implemented in this research. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it identifies potential data and mechanisms to generate Android mobile forensic datasets using customized data population. Second, it creates a foundation for future research on the topic of mobile forensic emulators for training purposes.

By generating photorealistic images and videos, these networks can pose a major technological disruption to a broad range of industries from medical imaging to virtual reality. However, as artwork developed by generative algorithms and cognitive robotics enters the arena, the notion of human-driven creativity has been thoroughly tested. When creativity is automated by the programmer, in a style determined by the trainer, using features from information available in public and private datasets, who is the proprietary owner of the rights in AI-generated artworks and designs? This Perspective seeks to provide an answer by systematically exploring the key issues in copyright law that arise at each phase of artificial creativity, from programming to deployment. Ultimately, four guiding actions are established for artists, programmers and end users that utilize AI as a tool such that they may be appropriately awarded the necessary proprietary rights.},

Many protection measures are put in place to make it deliberately difﬁcult to access raw data in order to protect intellectual property, enhance digital rights management of software and, ultimately, to protect against piracy. History has shown that many such protections on game consoles are circumvented with exploits leading to jailbreaking/rooting and allowing unauthorized software to be launched on the games system. This paper details methods that enable the investigator to extract system activity, deleted images, Internet history items, relevant friends list information, the console's serial number and plaintext WiFi access point passwords. This is all possible with the use of publicly available, open-source security circumvention techniques that perform a non-invasive physical dump of the internal NAND storage of the Nintendo 3DS handheld device. It will also be shown that forensic integrity is maintained and a detailed analysis is possible without altering original evidence.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.diin.2018.04.012},
	abstract = {It is not uncommon that mobile phones are involved in criminal activities, e.g., the surreptitious collection of credit card information. Forensic analysis of mobile applications plays a crucial part in order to gather evidences against criminals. However, traditional forensic approaches, which are based on manual investigation, are not scalable to the large number of mobile applications. On the other hand, dynamic analysis is hard to automate due to the burden of setting up the proper runtime environment to accommodate OS differences and dependent libraries and activate all feasible program paths. We propose a fully automated tool, Fordroid for the forensic analysis of mobile applications on Android. Fordroid conducts inter-component static analysis on Android APKs and builds control flow and data dependency graphs. Furthermore, Fordroid identifies what and where information written in local storage with taint analysis. Data is located by traversing the graphs. This addresses several technique challenges, which include inter-component string propagation, string operations (e.g., append) and API invocations. Also, Fordroid identifies how the information is stored by parsing SQL commands, i.e., the structure of database tables. Finally, we selected 100 random Android applications consisting of 2841 components from four categories for evaluation. Analysis of all apps took 64 h. Fordroid discovered 469 paths in 36 applications that wrote sensitive information (e.g., GPS) to local storage. Furthermore, Fordroid successfully located where the information was written for 458 (98\%) paths and identified the structure of all (22) database tables.},

	abstract = {With the rapid growth of the World Wide Web and Internet of Things, a huge amount of digital data is being produced every day. Digital forensics investigators face an uphill task when they have to manually screen through and examine tons of such data during a crime investigation. To expedite this process, several automated techniques have been proposed and are being used in practice. Among which tools based on Approximate Matching algorithms have gained prominence, e.g., ssdeep, sdhash, mvHash etc. These tools produce hash signatures for all the ﬁles to be examined, compute a similarity score and then compare it with a known reference set to ﬁlter out known good as well as bad ﬁles. In this way, exact as well as similar matches can be screened out. However, all of these schemes have been shown to be prone to active adversary attack, whereby an attacker, by making feasible changes in the content of the ﬁle, intelligently modiﬁes the ﬁnal hash signature produced to evade detection. Thus, an alternate hashing scheme is required which can resist this attack. In this work, we propose a new Approximate Matching scheme termed as - FbHash. We show that our scheme is secure against active attacks and detects similarity with 98\% accuracy. We also provide a detailed comparative analysis with other existing schemes and show that our scheme has a 28\% higher accuracy rate than other schemes for uncompressed ﬁle format (e.g., text ﬁles) and 50\% higher accuracy rate for compressed ﬁle format (e.g., docx etc.). Our proposed scheme is able to correlate a fragment as small as 1\% to the source ﬁle with 100\% detection rate and able to detect commonality as small as 1\% between two documents with appropriate similarity score. Further, our scheme also produces the least false negatives in comparison to other schemes.},

	abstract = {The need for computer forensics education continues to grow, as digital evidence is present in more crimes, whether the crimes directly involve computers or not. An essential component of training in computer forensics is hands-on, realistic laboratory assignments. Creating detailed, realistic lab assignments, however, is a difficult task. The “crime” must be played out on the machine, often in real-time, since timestamps present in numerous places in the system, such as files and logs, must be discovered and examined by students. Developing, running, and evaluating the labs can be labor intensive and instructors have limited time to spend on creating and grading laboratory experiments. We are developing FALCON (Framework for Laboratory Exercises Conducted Over Networks), an extensible framework that addresses the problem of creating, running, and evaluating detailed, realistic computer laboratory assignments in computer forensics. FALCON includes a component that enables instructors to set up scenarios on virtual target machines for the students to investigate. Existing tools for both “live” and “dead” machine investigations can be integrated into FALCON. In addition, FALCON logs all student activity for automated assessment of student performance. Currently, FALCON is a work in progress and some tasks remain manual. The goal is to automatically transform high-level descriptions of digital forensics scenarios into detailed investigative targets which contain activities derived from the scenarios, as well as historical activity (timestamps, logs, history, etc.). While the initial version of FALCON focuses on computer forensics, it will be extensible to other areas, such as incident response, as well as general computer security instruction.},

A unique characteristic of the evolution of digital forensics is that it has been largely driven by practitioners in the field. As a result, the majority of the educational experiences have been developed in response to identified weaknesses in the system or to train individuals on the use of a specific tool or technique, rather than as a result of educational needs assessments based on an accepted common body of knowledge. In June, 2008 a group of digital forensics researchers, educators and practitioners met as a working group at the Colloquium for Information Systems Security Education (CISSE 2008) to brainstorm ideas for the development of a research, education, and outreach agenda for Digital Forensics. This paper presents the research in education needs that the group identified associated with the development of a digital forensics education agenda.},

The goal of this project work is to establish a series of hands-on computer forensic labs, which help students prepare to accede seamlessly into the law enforcement workforce and to make these labs available online by exploiting technologies of Web-based learning and future web developments, one of this includes the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web will enable intelligent services by several methods which all work towards making information machine-understandable [3]. With this we hope to develop an intelligent Web-based educational system which is capable of demonstrating some form of knowledge-based reasoning in lab sequencing, in analysis of the student's answers combining with students' background, and in providing interactive problem-solving support to the student, all adapted to the Web technology [3].},

	abstract = {Internet connectivity and digital technologies have experienced exponential growth in the past few years. This explosion has spurred a significant increase in crime while also creating a new definition of cybercriminals. Digital Forensics plays an important role in crime reconstruction and thus the need for skilled forensics experts has multiplied. As a result, digital forensics education and training has also experienced radical growth. Teaching digital forensics has always been a challenge as the creation of suitable hands-on digital forensics labs has always been the core of these training programs. There are several challenges faced by both the educators and the students when it comes to the creation and implementation of digital forensics labs. This paper aims to address some of these issues by providing a framework that can be used by educators to establish educational hands-on labs for digital forensics. Firstly, we identify all the challenges faced by digital examiners, educators, and training professionals to deliver high-quality forensic labs. Secondly, we identify specific common technical pitfalls that professionals run into when designing digital forensics labs such as the creation of large image files. We thus, offer tips and tricks to make the process of creating digital forensic labs easier. Finally, we also provide a data set of small-sized image files that can be used by educators for the creation of a digital forensic lab infrastructure.},

We then re-categorize knowledge units of digital forensics based on the artifact generators for measuring the coverage of learning outcomes and topics. Finally, we utilize a real-world cybercrime scenario to demonstrate how knowledge units, digital forensics topics, concepts, artifacts, and investigation tools can be infused into each lab through active learning. The repository of the instructional materials is publicly available on GitHub. It has gained nearly 600 stars and 22k views within several months.},

We then devise an extended anti-forensic taxonomy to the one proposed by Rogers (2006) in order to create a more comprehensive taxonomy and facilitate linguistic standardization. Our work also takes into consideration anti-forensic activity which utilizes tools that were not originally designed for anti-forensic purposes, but can still be used with malicious intent. This category was labeled as Possible indications of anti-forensic activity, as certain software, scenarios, and digital artifacts could indicate anti-forensic activity on a system. We also publicly share our data sets, which includes categorical data on 308 collected anti-forensic tools, as well as 2780 unique hash values related to the installation files of 191 publicly available anti-forensic tools. As part of our analysis, the collected hash set was ran against the National Institute of Standards and Technology's 2016 National Software Reference Library, and only 423 matches were found out of the 2780 hashes. Our findings indicate a need for future endeavors in creating and maintaining exhaustive anti-forensic hash data sets.},

Along with measuring key quality metrics, such as true-positives, and false-positives, it also measures operational performance, such as for the speed of success, CPU utilization and memory usage. This is used to determine the basic footprint of the package-under-test. The paper presents a proof-of-concept of the system using the VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) within the vCenter Cloud management in-frastructure, which provides a cluster environment, and supports the cre-ation and instantiation of a well-defined virtual test operation system. The infrastructure has been used within a teaching environment for two semesters, and has been shown to cope well in terms of performance and administration. Two key evaluation points related to whether a cloud-based infrastructure will provide improvement on existing stand-alone and workstation-based virtualisation are related to the improvement in energy consumption and in the CPU utilization footprint for each virtual machine. Thus the results show some metrics related to the energy and CPU consumptions of the created digital forensics instances, which can be used to justify the improvements in energy consumption, as opposed to stand-alone instances, and in the scalability of the infrastructure.},

	abstract = {Bots are automated programs that robotically navigate the website, upload the data on servers and scrape the data from websites. According to numerous bot traffic reports nearly fifty percent of the website traffic is coming from automated programs. In recent years we have seen a rise in cyber crimes such as illegal web scraping using automated bots. Facebook filed and won a case against Power.com for illegally scraping the Facebook data. Recently in one of the biggest online ticketing scams, a man was arrested for illegally booking tickets using automated bots. While mitigating cyber crime, web forensic investigators face numerous challenges and issues dealing with bot crimes. Most of the existing research is based on web access logs which contain very basic and limited information. In this paper, we propose four phase web forensic framework to guide forensic examiners in their expedition to verify if the crime is done using automated bots. In order to evaluate the proposed framework, we applied it to the real web application and experimental case scenario. For this case study, a bot crime scenario is developed in an investigation environment. Subsequently, we present in depth forensic procedures and technical reports for bot crime investigation.},

	abstract = {IoT device forensics is a difficult problem given that manufactured IoT devices are not standardized, many store little to no historical data, and are always connected; making them extremely volatile. The goal of this paper was to address these challenges by presenting a primary account for a general framework and practical approach we term Forensic State Acquisition from Internet of Things (FSAIoT). We argue that by leveraging the acquisition of the state of IoT devices (e.g. if an IoT lock is open or locked), it becomes possible to paint a clear picture of events that have occurred. To this end, FSAIoT consists of a centralized Forensic State Acquisition Controller (FSAC) employed in three state collection modes: controller to IoT device, controller to cloud, and controller to controller. We present a proof of concept implementation using openHAB -- a device agnostic open source IoT device controller -- and self-created scripts, to resemble a FSAC implementation. Our proof of concept employed an Insteon IP Camera as a controller to device test, an Insteon Hub as a controller to controller test, and a nest thermostat for a a controller to cloud test. Our findings show that it is possible to practically pull forensically relevant state data from IoT devices. Future work and open research problems are shared.},

Mostly different sources of digital traces have to be inspected including persistent storage devices (e.g., SSDs, SD cards, USB drives), volatile main memory snapshots, and network captures, respectively. In order to train experts and tools and keep their knowledge and capabilities up-to-date, a capacious amount of realistic, timely training data is necessary. However, due to different reasons like privacy, secrecy, or intellectual property rights there is a large gap in digital forensic training data. In recent years different synthesis frameworks to generate realistic digital forensic data sets have been proposed. However, none of these frameworks provides a holistic approach to generate realistic digital forensic relevant traces of different sources. In this paper we introduce ForTrace, a holistic framework for the simultaneous generation of persistent, volatile and network traces. Our approach is based on the data synthesis framework hystck. We explain our extension of hystck by defining properties of a holistic data set synthesis framework and by discussing different forensically relevant scenarios and their implementation in ForTrace. We then successfully evaluate ForTrace with respect to diverse realistic and complex scenarios. ForTrace is open source and may be adapted or extended with respect to individual needs.},

	abstract = {Education and training in digital forensics requires a variety of suitable challenge corpora containing realistic features including regular wear-and-tear, background noise, and the actual digital traces to be discovered during investigation. Typically, the creation of these challenges requires overly arduous effort on the part of the educator to ensure their viability. Once created, the challenge image needs to be stored and distributed to a class for practical training. This storage and distribution step requires significant time and resources and may not even be possible in an online/distance learning scenario due to the data sizes involved. As part of this paper, we introduce a more capable methodology and system as an alternative to current approaches. EviPlant is a system designed for the efficient creation, manipulation, storage and distribution of challenges for digital forensics education and training. The system relies on the initial distribution of base disk images, i.e., images containing solely base operating systems. In order to create challenges for students, educators can boot the base system, emulate the desired activity and perform a “diffing” of resultant image and the base image. This diffing process extracts the modified artefacts and associated metadata and stores them in an “evidence package”. Evidence packages can be created for different personae, different wear-and-tear, different emulated crimes, etc., and multiple evidence packages can be distributed to students and integrated into the base images. A number of additional applications in digital forensic challenge creation for tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, and malware analysis are also discussed as a result of using EviPlant.},

We, therefore, reviewed automation literature (in the domain of digital forensics and other domains), performed three practitioner interviews, and discussed the topic with domain experts from academia. On this basis, we propose a definition and then showcase several considerations concerning automation for digital forensics, e.g., what we classify as no/basic automation or full automation (autonomous).

	abstract = {With the growing number of digital forensic tools and the increasing use of digital forensics in various contexts, including incident response and cyber threat intelligence, there is a pressing need for a widely accepted standard for representing and exchanging digital forensic information. Such a standard representation can support correlation between different data sources, enabling more effective and efficient querying and analysis of digital evidence. This work summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of existing schemas, and proposes the open-source CybOX schema as a foundation for storing and sharing digital forensic information. The suitability of CybOX for representing objects and relationships that are common in forensic investigations is demonstrated with examples involving digital evidence. The capability to represent provenance by leveraging CybOX is also demonstrated, including specifics of the tool used to process digital evidence and the resulting output. An example is provided of an ongoing project that uses CybOX to record the state of a system before and after an event in order to capture cause and effect information that can be useful for digital forensics. An additional open-source schema and associated ontology called Digital Forensic Analysis eXpression (DFAX) is proposed that provides a layer of domain specific information overlaid on CybOX. DFAX extends the capability of CybOX to represent more abstract forensic-relevant actions, including actions performed by subjects and by forensic examiners, which can be useful for sharing knowledge and supporting more advanced forensic analysis. DFAX can be used in combination with other existing schemas for representing identity information (CIQ), and location information (KML). This work also introduces and leverages initial steps of a Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) effort to abstract and express concepts/constructs that are common across the cyber domain.},

	abstract = {Any investigation can have a digital dimension, often involving information from multiple data sources, organizations and jurisdictions. Existing approaches to representing and exchanging cyber-investigation information are inadequate, particularly when combining data sources from numerous organizations or dealing with large amounts of data from various tools. To conduct investigations effectively, there is a pressing need to harmonize how this information is represented and exchanged. This paper addresses this need for information exchange and tool interoperability with an open community-developed specification language called Cyber-investigation Analysis Standard Expression (CASE). To further promote a common structure, CASE aligns with and extends the Unified Cyber Ontology (UCO) construct, which provides a format for representing information in all cyber domains. This ontology abstracts objects and concepts that are not CASE-specific, so that they can be used across other cyber disciplines that may extend UCO. This work is a rational evolution of the Digital Forensic Analysis eXpression (DFAX) for representing digital forensic information and provenance. CASE is more flexible than DFAX and can be utilized in any context, including criminal, corporate and intelligence. CASE also builds on the Hansken data model developed and implemented by the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI). CASE enables the fusion of information from different organizations, data sources, and forensic tools to foster more comprehensive and cohesive analysis. This paper includes illustrative examples of how CASE can be implemented and used to capture information in a structured form to advance sharing, interoperability and analysis in cyber-investigations. In addition to capturing technical details and relationships between objects, CASE provides structure for representing and sharing details about how cyber-information was handled, transferred, processed, analyzed, and interpreted. CASE also supports data marking for sharing information at different levels of trust and classification, and for protecting sensitive and private information. Furthermore, CASE supports the sharing of knowledge related to cyber-investigations, including distinctive patterns of activity/behavior that are common across cases. This paper features a proof-of-concept Application Program Interface (API) to facilitate implementation of CASE in tools. Community members are encouraged to participate in the development and implementation of CASE and UCO.},

	abstract = {Personal electronic devices such as smartphones and smartwatches have become indispensable daily companions, collecting a multitude of personal and sensitive data. As a result, they are of paramount importance in digital forensic examinations. However, there is a lack of publicly available and ready-to-use digital forensic datasets, especially in mobile forensics. This work presents a concept and an open-source proof-of-concept implementation, which simplifies and automates the creation of mobile forensic datasets within the scope of the Android operating system. In contrast to previous approaches, which populate the most common databases of an Android device, our concept is based on community-driven playbooks and makes use of interaction with the actual smartphone GUI. Hence, we are able to generate coherent and realistic traces as they occur in real-world human usage. Our proof-of-concept implementation is based on the standard Android emulation environment and borrows tools from the user interface testing community. Our evaluation shows that our approach actually generates realistic Android datasets. For instance, we can generate traces that cannot be simulated by gestures (e.g., changing the GPS position or triggering incoming phone calls). Recording the actual data synthesis process allows users to either create and share their own playbooks (i.e., the exact instructions for the data synthesis process rather than having to share the full image) or reproduce Android images with different scenarios using playbooks previously created and shared by the community.},

	abstract = {Digital forensic test images are commonly used across a variety of digital forensic use cases including education and training, tool testing and validation, proficiency testing, malware analysis, and research and development. Using real digital evidence for these purposes is often not viable or permissible, especially when factoring in the ethical and in some cases legal considerations of working with individuals' personal data. Furthermore, when using real data it is not usually known what actions were performed when, i.e., what was the ‘ground truth’. The creation of synthetic digital forensic test images typically involves an arduous, time-consuming process of manually performing a list of actions, or following a ‘story’ to generate artefacts in a subsequently imaged disk. Besides the manual effort and time needed in executing the relevant actions in the scenario, there is often little room to build a realistic volume of non-pertinent wear-and-tear or ‘background noise’ on the suspect device, meaning the resulting disk images are inherently limited and to a certain extent simplistic. This work presents the TraceGen framework, an automated system focused on the emulation of user actions to create realistic and comprehensive artefacts in an auditable and reproducible manner. The framework consists of a series of actions contained within scripts that are executed both externally and internally to a target virtual machine. These actions use existing automation APIs to emulate a real user's behaviour on a Windows system to generate realistic and comprehensive artefacts. These actions can be quickly scripted together to form complex stories or to emulate wear-and-tear on the test image. In addition to the development of the framework, evaluation is also performed in terms of the ability to produce background artefacts at scale, and also the realism of the artefacts compared with their human-generated counterparts.},

In order to test, test datasets are required, but creating these is not a straightforward task. A poorly constructed and documented test dataset undermines any testing which has taken place using it, eroding the reliability of any subsequent test results. In essence, given the time, effort and knowledge required to generate datasets, the field must guide those carrying out this task to ensure that it is done right at the first instance without wasting resources. Yet, there are currently few standards and best practices defined for dataset creation in digital forensics. This work defines three categories of dataset which typically exist in digital forensic - tool/process evaluation datasets, actions datasets and scenario-based datasets, where the minimum requirements for their creation are outlined and discussed to support those creating them and to help ensure that where datasets are created, they offer maximum value to the field.},

This paper discusses the results and provides conclusions that indicate that at least in this context, there is much interest among practitioners towards the technology. However, more research is needed to make model creation and maintenance as easy as possible. In addition, metrics should be developed that can be used to report test results in the same manner as using existing testing techniques, enabling comparison between different approaches. Special emphasis should also be placed on enabling quick bug localization. Furthermore, it seems that successful pilot projects are a key to wider industrial adoption.

	abstract = {Traditional hard drives are slowly becoming things of the past as newer technologies are constantly demanding lighter, faster, and more reliable alternatives. Solid-state media have started to permeate the market in an effort to satisfy this demand. Some tech giants have already started to use solid-state media in their products but are facing substantial price and storage capacity penalties. When it comes to performing forensic analysis on these solid-state media, the autonomous behavior of the media does not look promising as it has serious reliability issues compared to traditional media. With wear-leveling always enabled, the persistence of deleted data is always in question. The deleted data can stay on the media either partially or wholly and is dependent on various factors like the file system used on the media, capacity, manufacturer, software level TRIM functionality and also on the type of the operating system used. In this research, we analyzed different types of flash and solid-state media by filling them up with different types of files an conducted exhaustive experiments to identify the probability of recovering and file-carving once these files are deleted. The aim of this paper is to give a detailed analysis that will provide a benchmark for digital forensics investigators who are constantly troubled by the thought of analyzing solid-state media.},

While recent advances in CPU architectures and new virtualization techniques have reduced the performance cost of using virtualization, overheads still exist, particularly when multiple virtual machines are competing for resources. We have performed an extensive performance comparison under hardware-assisted virtualization settings considering four popular virtualization platforms, Hyper-V, KVM, vSphere and Xen, and find that the overheads incurred by each hypervisor can vary significantly depending on the type of application and the resources assigned to it. We also find dramatic differences in the performance isolation provided by different hypervisors. However, we find no single hypervisor always outperforms the others. This suggests that effectively managing hypervisor diversity in order to match applications to the best platform is an important, yet unstudied, challenge.},

Due to the increasing pervasiveness of mobile devices like smartphones or tablets, the need for mobile forensic datasets is growing, too. However, publications in the IT forensic community show that there is a large gap in publicly available datasets. In this work we focus on mobile digital forensic corpora as one of the main fields of missing datasets and aim at shifting the focus of the digital forensic community on this topic. In order to do so, we provide three main contributions. We first perform a structured search for mobile forensic corpora and show that 31 publicly available mobile forensic corpora exist, 9 of them more than 5 years old and 18 of them more than 3 years old. Second, we assess these datasets with respect to its content compared to an ordinary real mobile image and conclude that most of the 31 datasets contain too few traces to be considered as realistic. Finally, we propose how to proceed to solve the presumable problem of missing mobile forensic datasets.},

	abstract = {Mobile phones and mobile applications have now become an integral part of our everyday life. Mobile application testing plays a pivotal role in making the mobile applications more reliable and defect free. Existing test automation tools have been tailored to perform mobile test automation through mobile emulators. Other tools require the mobile device where the application is installed, to be connected to a computer so that the tests can be run. Obviously, the results obtained from emulators often differ from those obtained on actual mobile devices. To our best knowledge only a few solutions for creating automated tests of mobile applications exist and their functionality is very limited. In this paper, we introduce the idea of implementing a mobile test automation framework MobTAF which performs mobile test automation on the mobile device where connection to a computer is not required. The framework moves the testing infrastructure to the phone, to support test situations that cannot easily be replicated with an emulator. A prototype application was then implemented to test the mobile automation framework, MobTAF. The results prove that MobTAF framework is an efficient way of performing mobile application tests directly on the mobile devices.},

With the goal of helping researchers and practitioners - who design approaches supporting mobile testing - to understand developer's needs, we analyzed survey responses from 102 open source contributors to Android projects about their practices when performing testing. The survey focused on questions regarding practices and preferences of developers/testers in-the-wild for (i) designing and generating test cases, (ii) automated testing practices, and (iii) perceptions of quality metrics such as code coverage for determining test quality. Analyzing the information gleaned from this survey, we compile a body of knowledge to help guide researchers and professionals toward tailoring new automated testing approaches to the need of a diverse set of open source developers.},

Existing web agents typically only handle one input modality and are evaluated only in simplified web simulators or static web snapshots, greatly limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce WebVoyager, an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end-to-end by interacting with real-world websites. Moreover, we establish a new benchmark by compiling real-world tasks from 15 popular websites and introduce an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging multimodal understanding abilities of GPT-4V to evaluate open-ended web agents. We show that WebVoyager achieves a 59.1\% task success rate on our benchmark, significantly surpassing the performance of both GPT-4 (All Tools) and the WebVoyager (text-only) setups, underscoring the exceptional capability of WebVoyager. The proposed automatic evaluation metric achieves 85.3\% agreement with human judgment, indicating its effectiveness in providing reliable and accurate assessments of web agents.},

	abstract = {With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41\%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24\%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.},

However, existing benchmarks either lack an interactive environment or are limited to environments specific to certain applications or domains, failing to reflect the diverse and complex nature of real-world computer use, thereby limiting the scope of tasks and agent scalability. To address this issue, we introduce OSWorld, the first-of-its-kind scalable, real computer environment for multimodal agents, supporting task setup, execution-based evaluation, and interactive learning across various operating systems such as Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS. OSWorld can serve as a unified, integrated computer environment for assessing open-ended computer tasks that involve arbitrary applications. Building upon OSWorld, we create a benchmark of 369 computer tasks involving real web and desktop apps in open domains, OS file I/O, and workflows spanning multiple applications. Each task example is derived from real-world computer use cases and includes a detailed initial state setup configuration and a custom execution-based evaluation script for reliable, reproducible evaluation. Extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM/VLM-based agents on OSWorld reveals significant deficiencies in their ability to serve as computer assistants. While humans can accomplish over 72.36\% of the tasks, the best model achieves only 12.24\% success, primarily struggling with GUI grounding and operational knowledge. Comprehensive analysis using OSWorld provides valuable insights for developing multimodal generalist agents that were not possible with previous benchmarks.

	abstract = {Most software systems used in production generate system logs that provide a rich source of information about the status and execution behavior of the system. These logs are commonly used to ensure the reliability and maintainability of software systems. The first step toward automated log analysis is generally log parsing, which aims to transform unstructured log messages into structured log templates and extract the corresponding parameters.Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown promising results on a wide range of software engineering tasks, including log parsing. However, the extent to which non-determinism influences log parsing using LLMs remains unclear. In particular, it is important to investigate whether LLMs behave consistently when faced with the same log message multiple times.In this study, we investigate the impact of non-determinism in state-of-the-art LLMs while performing log parsing. Specifically, we select six LLMs, including both paid proprietary and free-to-use models, and evaluate their non-determinism on 16 system logs obtained from a selection of mature open-source projects. The results of our study reveal varying degrees of non-determinism among models. Moreover, they show that there is no guarantee for deterministic results even with a temperature of zero.},

Our study addresses this issue by exploring key questions about the performance differences between greedy decoding and sampling, identifying benchmarks' consistency regarding non-determinism, and examining unique model behaviors. Through extensive experiments, we observe that greedy decoding generally outperforms sampling methods for most evaluated tasks. We also observe consistent performance across different LLM sizes and alignment methods, noting that alignment can reduce sampling variance. Moreover, our best-of-N sampling approach demonstrates that smaller LLMs can match or surpass larger models such as GPT-4-Turbo, highlighting the untapped potential of smaller LLMs. This research shows the importance of considering non-determinism in LLM evaluations and provides insights for future LLM development and evaluation.},

	abstract = {There has been a recent explosion of research on Large Language Models (LLMs) for software engineering tasks, in particular code generation. However, results from LLMs can be highly unstable; non-deterministically returning very different code for the same prompt. Such non-determinism affects the correctness and consistency of the generated code, undermines developers’ trust in LLMs, and yields low reproducibility in LLM-based papers. Nevertheless, there is no work investigating how serious this non-determinism threat is.To fill this gap, this article conducts an empirical study on the non-determinism of ChatGPT in code generation. We chose to study ChatGPT because it is already highly prevalent in the code generation research literature. We report results from a study of 829 code generation problems across three code generation benchmarks (i.e., CodeContests, APPS and HumanEval) with three aspects of code similarities: semantic similarity, syntactic similarity, and structural similarity. Our results reveal that ChatGPT exhibits a high degree of non-determinism under the default setting: the ratio of coding tasks with zero equal test output across different requests is 75.76\%, 51.00\% and 47.56\% for three different code generation datasets (i.e., CodeContests, APPS and HumanEval), respectively. In addition, we find that setting the temperature to 0 does not guarantee determinism in code generation, although it indeed brings less non-determinism than the default configuration (temperature  {\textbackslash}(={\textbackslash})  1). In order to put LLM-based research on firmer scientific foundations, researchers need to take into account non-determinism in drawing their conclusions.},

	abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that systems with unencrypted DRAM interfaces are susceptible to cold boot attacks - where the DRAM in a system is frozen to give it sufficient retention time and is then re-read after reboot, or is transferred to an attacker's machine for extracting sensitive data. This method has been shown to be an effective attack vector for extracting disk encryption keys out of locked devices. However, most modern systems incorporate some form of data scrambling into their DRAM interfaces making cold boot attacks challenging. While first added as a measure to improve signal integrity and reduce power supply noise, these scramblers today serve the added purpose of obscuring the DRAM contents. It has previously been shown that scrambled DDR3 systems do not provide meaningful protection against cold boot attacks. In this paper, we investigate the enhancements that have been introduced in DDR4 memory scramblers in the 6th generation Intel Core (Skylake) processors. We then present an attack that demonstrates these enhanced DDR4 scramblers still do not provide sufficient protection against cold boot attacks. We detail a proof-of-concept attack that extracts memory resident AES keys, including disk encryption keys. The limitations of memory scramblers we point out in this paper motivate the need for strong yet low-overhead fullmemory encryption schemes. Existing schemes such as Intel's SGX can effectively prevent such attacks, but have overheads that may not be acceptable for performance-sensitive applications. However, it is possible to deploy a memory encryption scheme that has zero performance overhead by forgoing integrity checking and replay attack protections afforded by Intel SGX. To that end, we present analyses that confirm modern stream ciphers such as ChaCha8 are sufficiently fast that it is now possible to completely overlap keystream generation with DRAM row buffer access latency, thereby enabling the creation of strongly encrypted DRAMs with zero exposed latency. Adopting such low-overhead measures in future generation of products can effectively shut down cold boot attacks in systems where the overhead of existing memory encryption schemes is unacceptable. Furthermore, the emergence of non-volatile DIMMs that fit into DDR4 buses is going to exacerbate the risk of cold boot attacks. Hence, strong full memory encryption is going to be even more crucial on such systems.},

Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.},

Compared to previous versions of Stable Diffusion, SDXL leverages a three times larger UNet backbone: The increase of model parameters is mainly due to more attention blocks and a larger cross-attention context as SDXL uses a second text encoder. We design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. We also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL shows drastically improved performance compared the previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators. In the spirit of promoting open research and fostering transparency in large model training and evaluation, we provide access to code and model weights at https://github.com/Stability-AI/generative-models},

	abstract = {Python is one of the most popular programming languages among both industry developers and malware authors. Despite demand for Python decompilers, community efforts to maintain automatic Python decompilation tools have been hindered by Python's aggressive language improvements and unstable bytecode specification. Every year, language features are added, code generation undergoes significant changes, and opcodes are added, deleted, and modified. Our research aims to integrate NLP techniques with classical PL theory to create a Python decompiler that accomodates evolving language features and changes to the bytecode specification with minimal human maintenance effort. PyLingual plugs in data-driven NLP components to a version-agnostic core to automatically absorb superficial bytecode and compiler changes, while leveraging programmatic components for abstract control flow reconstruction. To establish trust in the decompilation results, we introduce a stringent correctness measure based on "perfect decompilation", a statically verifiable refinement of semantic equivalence. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with extensive real-world datasets of benign and malicious Python source code and their corresponding compiled PYC binaries. Our research makes three major contributions: (1) we present PyLingual, a scalable, data-driven decompilation framework with state-of-the-art support for Python versions 3.6 through 3.12, improving the perfect decompilation rate by an average of 45\% over the best results of existing decompiler across four datasets; (2) we provide a Python decompiler evaluation framework that verifies decompilation results with perfect decompilation; and (3) we launch PyLingual as a public online service.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the specification of the Cloud-based DFET platform which is used to evaluate the performance of digital forensics tools, which aim to detect the presence of trails of evidence, such as for the presence of illicit images and determination of user accounts from a host. Along with measuring key quality metrics, such as truepositives, and false-positives, it also measures operational performance, such as for the speed of success, CPU utilization and memory usage. This is used to determine the basic footprint of the package-under-test. The paper presents a proof-of-concept of the system using the VMware vSphere Hypervisor (ESXi) within the vCenter Cloud management infrastructure, which provides a cluster environment, and supports the creation and instantiation of a well-defined virtual test operation system. The infrastructure has been used within a teaching environment for two semesters, and has been shown to cope well in terms of performance and administration. Two key evaluation points related to whether a cloudbased infrastructure will provide improvement on existing stand-alone and workstation-based virtualisation are related to the improvement in energy consumption and in the CPU utilization footprint for each virtual machine. Thus the results show some metrics related to the energy and CPU consumptions of the created digital forensics instances, which can be used to justify the improvements in energy consumption, as opposed to stand-alone instances, and in the scalability of the infrastructure.},
