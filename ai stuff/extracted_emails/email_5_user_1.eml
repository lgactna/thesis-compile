Great questions! Compared to traditional tools, our new product offers a 30% improvement in processing speed and a 20% reduction in operational costs. We've also designed it with modularity in mind, allowing for easy customization based on customer needs.  

As for events, we're planning to showcase this tool at the International Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference later this year. Stay tuned for more updates!
