\begin{itemize}
\item
  Synthesizers are not to be italicized. Every mention of a synthesizer
  in a paragraph not focusing on that synthesizer should have a
  citation.
\item
  Bulleted lists should have their key element \textbf{bolded} where
  applicable.
\item
  Tools or libraries may be \passthrough{\lstinline!monospace!} to
  distinguish them from regular text. Use this sparingly; tools with
  ``actual names'' should have no formatting applied. (for example:
  \passthrough{\lstinline!uv!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!dfvfs!}, the
  Digital Forensics Virtual Filesystem, Pydantic, CASE,
  \passthrough{\lstinline!caselib!})
\item
  Italicization \emph{for emphasis} is allowed. Bolding for emphasis is
  not.
\item
  Italicization for ``proper'' terms, such as the names of modules, is
  allowed but should be limited in usage.
\end{itemize}
