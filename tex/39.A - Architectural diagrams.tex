\autoref{fig:mini-full} is a complete representation of the AKF
architecture, excluding labels. The remaining diagrams in this appendix
chapter focus on individual modules in greater detail;
\autoref{fig:mini-full} is intended to help the reader understand the
relationships between individual sub-diagrams.

labels}\label{fig:mini-full}

Modules related to scenario construction, as described in \autoref{chapter-six}, are depicted in \autoref{fig:architecture-full-a}.

The action automation library, described throughout \autoref{chapter-four}, is depicted in \autoref{fig:architecture-full-b}.

The output and validation library, described throughout \autoref{chapter-five}, is depicted in
\autoref{fig:architecture-full-c}. Note that this is distinct from
\autoref{fig:output-full}, which includes various virtual machine
outputs due to their role in the chapter's discussion.

Finally, the virtualized environment and its agent, also described
throughout \autoref{chapter-four}, is depicted in
\autoref{fig:architecture-full-d}. Note that some elements depicted in
this figure are also described in \autoref{chapter-five}
and \autoref{chapter-six}.
