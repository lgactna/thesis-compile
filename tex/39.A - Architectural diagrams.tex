\autoref{fig:mini-full} is a complete representation of the AKF
architecture, excluding labels. The remaining diagrams in this appendix
chapter focus on individual modules in greater detail;
\autoref{fig:mini-full} is intended to help the reader understand the
relationships between individual sub-diagrams, which contain the labels
omitted from this figure.

The following conventions are used for all architectural figures
throughout this thesis, including those below:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Elements with a \textbf{solid border} refer to AKF submodules, which
  contain processing logic.
\item
  Elements with a \textbf{dotted border} refer to inputs, such as
  scripts and images, that should be used to construct a dataset.
\item
  Elements with a \textbf{dashed border} refer to outputs, such as disk
  images and memory dumps, that should be included with a complete
  dataset.
\end{itemize}

In general, colored boxes refer to a distinct module. The sole exception
is the \emph{translation unit} (colored green), which is distinctly
colored from other submodules due to its complexity.

The action automation library, described throughout \autoref{chapter-four}, is depicted in \autoref{fig:architecture-full-b}.

The virtualized environment and its agent, also described throughout
\autoref{chapter-four}, is depicted in
\autoref{fig:architecture-full-d}. Note that some elements depicted in
this figure are described in \autoref{chapter-five} and
\autoref{chapter-six}.

The output and validation library, described throughout \autoref{chapter-five}, is depicted in
\autoref{fig:architecture-full-c}. Note that this is distinct from
\autoref{fig:output-full}, which includes various virtual machine
outputs due to their role in the chapter's discussion.

Finally, modules related to scenario construction, as described in
\autoref{chapter-six}, are depicted in
\autoref{fig:architecture-full-a}.
