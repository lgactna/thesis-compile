Global notes

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Does the inclusion of the architectural diagram at the start of every
  chapter work, or should it just be included? Is it good/does it make
  sense/does it fit on the page? Do I need to describe it in greater
  detail, if I'm going to bother introducing it at all?
\item
  Does the introduction of each chapter work? Or is it too sudden?
\item
  Does the introduction of each chapter work? Or is it too sudden? hings
  that can be done Right Now:
\item
  5.2 (core outputs)
\item
  8.2 (future work), things that are out of scope that we
  \emph{definitely} know won't happen and therefore don't have to wait
  until we're done with implementation to figure out what didn't get
  done
\item
  9 (conclusion), it's just like one paragraph lmao
\item ~
  \subsection{9 (conclusion), it's just like one paragraph
  lmao}\label{conclusion-its-just-like-one-paragraph-lmao}

\textbf{39.0 - Abstract} Done (may require some light editing if we
don't fulfill all the promises made in the abstract)

\textbf{39.1 - Introduction} Done

\textbf{39.2 - Literature review} Done

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  \#task 2.1 - Write this entire section, probably mostly from
  \cite{grajedaAvailabilityDatasetsDigital2017} ðŸ“… 2025-02-08 âœ…

  2025-02-08 {[}39.3 - Architecture and design{]}{]} Done (unless the
  architecture diagram needs to be reworked, either to fit in better
  with the text or to actually move stuff around in the diagram itself)
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  \#task 3 - Consider incorporating concepts explicitly from
  \cite{horsmanDatasetConstructionChallenges2021} ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 âœ…
  2025-02-08
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  \#task 3.2 - Update the architecture diagram to look nicer, and remove
  all ``notes'' that are supposed to just be for me ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 âœ…
  2025-02-08
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  \#task 3.2 - Consider making the connection between the ``three
  distinct concepts'' and the diagram to be more clear, most likely by
  editing or adding a simpler diagram that provides a closer 1-1
  connection between those components ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 âœ… 2025-02-08

\item
  that is, you'd have one big scary diagram, and then a simplified
  version of the same diagram
\end{itemize}

\textbf{39.4 - Action automation}

\begin{itemize}
\item[$\boxtimes$]
  \#task 4 - Consider adding an inset diagram from the complete
  architectural diagram, and then briefly explaining what parts of the
  diagram correspond to which sections below; also consider moving the
  content into 4.1 ðŸ“… 2025-02-08 âœ… 2025-02-08
\item
  4.2 - after more agentless generation is implemented, it needs to be
  discussed in greater detail in the context of AKF
\item
  4.3 - add any new application-specific information to the table

\item[$\square$]
  \#task by extension: achieve feature party with what's discussed in
  ForTrace page 11, at least as close as possible ðŸ“… 2025-02-09
\item[$\square$]
  \#task 4.4 - after physical generation is implemented, it needs to be
  discussed in greater detail in the context of AKF ðŸ“… 2025-02-10

  {[}39.5 - Output and validation{]}{]}
\item
  5.1 - Consider removing this section and just having it be at the top
  level
\item[$\square$]
  \#task 5.2 - Write the entire section (how do we generate relevant
  outputs from the framework? how do we optimize these outputs for
  distribution and storage?) ðŸ“… 2025-02-08
\item
  5.3.3 - Show how the CASE bindings are actually used throughout AKF
\item
  5.4 - Write the entire section (human readable reporting) - also
  requires implementation

\item
  6.2 - Demonstrate what simple usage of the AKF libraries look like
