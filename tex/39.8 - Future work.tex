  So OpenAI has their
  \href{https://openai.com/index/introducing-operator/}{Operator} thing,
  it's important to take note that it exists and could likely be
  generalized to automate user actions more broadly -- however, there's
  three things to keep in mind:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    it likely can't substitute (right now) all of the features provided
    by AKF, such as the ability to manipulate low-level bytes or change
    the BIOS time, even if it had full knowledge of how to interact with
    the operating system
  \item
    Present models are
    \href{https://152334h.github.io/blog/non-determinism-in-gpt-4/}{known
    to be non-deterministic}, which is acceptable for educational
    purposes (so long as you have a framework that can log all of the
    actions it takes, or identify ground truth after the fact), but a
    little less so when building images that \emph{need} to be done
    deterministically, such as when developing images for research or
    tool validation

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      not to mention that it apparently
      \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/1i8jln3/i_am_among_the_first_people_to_gain_access_to/}{sucks
      at doing its job right now}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    Operator is not \emph{incompatible} with our architecture or overall
    framework -- it could likely be built as yet another \texttt{akflib}
    module or agent module, which would give users the option to choose
    between a simple, non-deterministic option for generating browser
    artifacts from human language, or a more complex, deterministic
    option by manually declaring actions.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Framework limitations and
extensions}\label{framework-limitations-and-extensions}

AKF was built with the expectation that it would be easy to maintain,
develop, and extend. Indeed, there are several use-cases that AKF does
not fulfill as of writing. This includes: - support for generating
mobile device datasets, although
