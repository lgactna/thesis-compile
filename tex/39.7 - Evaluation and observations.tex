\section{Context and scenario}\label{context-and-scenario}

What class was this used in, and elements of the class are worth
mentioning? What was the scenario we gave students? What was the context
provided to students about the dataset (for example, were they told this
was a synthetic dataset? if so, what were they told about it being
synthetic?)?

\section{Student analysis}\label{student-analysis}

How well were students able to analyze the scenario? If there were
specific items that we expected students to find, how many of these
items were identified in the reports that students created?

\section{Findings and
observations}\label{findings-and-observations}

Were there other things of note, like the students noticing traces of
AKF being left behind? Did students like the alternative scenario
compared to an existing, human-crafted scenario? What did students like
or dislike?
