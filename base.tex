As our world becomes increasingly dependent on technology, the
advancement of digital forensics has become a key focus in the fight
against cybercrime. The forensic community depends on the availability
of disk images, network captures, and other forensic artifacts for
education, tool validation, and research. However, real-world datasets
often contain sensitive information that may be difficult to remove,
making them challenging to distribute publicly. As a result, researchers
and educators can encounter gaps in available datasets, typically leading to
the manual development of new datasets. While viable, this approach is
time-consuming and rarely produces datasets that accurately reflect
real-world scenarios suitable for comprehensive training and education.
In turn, there is ongoing research into forensic synthesizers, which
automate the process of creating unique, synthetic datasets
that can be publicly distributed without legal and other logistical
concerns.

This thesis introduces the \emph{\emph{automated kinetic framework}}, or
AKF, a modular synthesizer for creating and interacting with virtualized
environments to simulate human activity. AKF significantly improves upon
the designs and implementations of prior synthesizers while largely
maintaining feature parity and usability. Additionally, AKF leverages
the CASE standard to provide human- and machine-readable reporting,
exposing low-level dataset features in a searchable format. Finally, this thesis
describes options for leveraging generative AI to develop high-level
scenarios as well as individual artifacts. These contributions are
intended to improve the speed at which synthetic datasets can be created
and ensure the long-term usefulness of AKF-generated datasets and the
framework as a whole.

\section*{Dedication}

To those in the osu! tournament community, without whom I would have
never embarked on this journey;

To my numerous teachers and professors, especially Keith Lightfoot,
Rodney Rogers, Marc Miller, and Gabbi Bachand, whom I have limitless
appreciation and admiration for;

To those on the United States Cyber Team and the broader CTF
community for igniting my interest in digital forensics and supporting
me even when I flailed like a fish out of water;

And, of course, to my friends, family, and bed, who provided support and motivation.
