Global notes

- Does the inclusion of the architectural diagram at the start of every chapter work, or should it just be included? Is it good/does it make sense/does it fit on the page? Do I need to describe it in greater detail, if I'm going to bother introducing it at all?
- Does the introduction of each chapter work? Or is it too sudden?

hings that can be done Right Now:

- 5.2 (core outputs)
- 8.2 (future work), things that are out of scope that we *definitely* know won't happen and therefore don't have to wait until we're done with implementation to figure out what didn't get done
- 9 (conclusion), it's just like one paragraph lmao

**39.0 - Abstract**
Done (may require some light editing if we don't fulfill all the promises made in the abstract)

**39.1 - Introduction**
Done

**39.2 - Literature review**
Done

- [x] #task 2.1 - Write this entire section, probably mostly from [@grajedaAvailabilityDatasetsDigital2017] ðŸ“… 2025-02-08 âœ… 2025-02-08

[39.3 - Architecture and design]]
Done (unless the architecture diagram needs to be reworked, either to fit in better with the text or to actually move stuff around in the diagram itself)

- [x] #task 3 - Consider incorporating concepts explicitly from [@horsmanDatasetConstructionChallenges2021] ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 âœ… 2025-02-08
- [x] #task 3.2 - Update the architecture diagram to look nicer, and remove all "notes" that are supposed to just be for me ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 âœ… 2025-02-08
- [x] #task 3.2 - Consider making the connection between the "three distinct concepts" and the diagram to be more clear, most likely by editing or adding a simpler diagram that provides a closer 1-1 connection between those components ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 âœ… 2025-02-08

- that is, you'd have one big scary diagram, and then a simplified version of the same diagram

**39.4 - Action automation**

- [x] #task 4 - Consider adding an inset diagram from the complete architectural diagram, and then briefly explaining what parts of the diagram correspond to which sections below; also consider moving the content into 4.1 ðŸ“… 2025-02-08 âœ… 2025-02-08
- 4.2 - after more agentless generation is implemented, it needs to be discussed in greater detail in the context of AKF
- 4.3 - add any new application-specific information to the table

- 4.3 - add any new application-specific information to the table
-  [ ] #task by extension: achieve feature party with what's discussed in ForTrace page 11, at least as close as possible ðŸ“… 2025-02-09 

- [ ] #task 4.4 - after physical generation is implemented, it needs to be discussed in greater detail in the context of AKF ðŸ“… 2025-02-10 

- [ ] #task 4.4 - after physical generation is implemented, it needs to be discussed in greater detail in the context of AKF ðŸ“… 2025-02-10 
[39.5 - Output and validation]]

- 5.1 - Consider removing this section and just having it be at the top level
- [ ] #task 5.2 - Write the entire section (how do we generate relevant outputs from the framework? how do we optimize these outputs for distribution and storage?) ðŸ“… 2025-02-08 
- 5.3.3 - Show how the CASE bindings are actually used throughout AKF
- 5.4 - Write the entire section (human readable reporting) - also requires implementation

- 5.4 - Write the entire section (human readable reporting) - also requires implementation
[39.6 - Building scenarios]]

- 6.2 - Demonstrate what simple usage of the AKF libraries look like
- 6.3 - Describe the design decisions and analysis of prior declarative languages, and also implement the declarative syntax + translator itself
- 6.4 - Describe using generative AI for artifacts
- 6.5 - Describing using generative AI for scenarios 

- 6.5 - Describing using generative AI for scenarios 
[39.7 - Evaluation and observations]]

- The whole thing â€“ can't be worked on unless we make enough progress

[39.8 - Future work]]

- The whole thing â€“ can't be worked on until we're close to running out of time and know what isn't happening

[39.9 - Conclusion]]

- Should be like one paragraph or whatever, difficult to talk about until we're actually there
