
**!fig:mini-full** is a complete representation of the AKF architecture, excluding labels. The remaining diagrams in this appendix chapter focus on individual modules in greater detail; **!fig:mini-full** is intended to help the reader understand the relationships between individual sub-diagrams, which contain the labels omitted from this figure.

The following conventions are used for all architectural figures throughout this thesis, including those below:

- Elements with a **solid border** refer to AKF submodules, which contain processing logic.
- Elements with a **dotted border** refer to inputs, such as scripts and images, that should be used to construct a dataset.
- Elements with a **dashed border** refer to outputs, such as disk images and memory dumps, that should be included with a complete dataset.

In general, colored boxes refer to a distinct module. The sole exception is the *translation unit* (colored green), which is distinctly colored from other submodules due to its complexity.

The action automation library, described throughout **39.4 - Action automation**, is depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-b**.

The virtualized environment and its agent, also described throughout **39.4 - Action automation**, is depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-d**. Note that some elements depicted in this figure are described in **39.5 - Output and validation** and **39.6 - Building scenarios**.

The output and validation library, described throughout **39.5 - Output and validation**, is depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-c**. Note that this is distinct from **!fig:output-full**, which includes various virtual machine outputs due to their role in the chapter's discussion.

Finally, modules related to scenario construction, as described in **39.6 - Building scenarios**, are depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-a**.
