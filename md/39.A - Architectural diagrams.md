
**!fig:mini-full** is a complete representation of the AKF architecture, excluding labels. The remaining diagrams in this appendix chapter focus on individual modules in greater detail; **!fig:mini-full** is intended to help the reader understand the relationships between individual sub-diagrams, which contain the labels omitted from this figure.

The virtualized environment and its agent, also described throughout **39.4 - Action automation**, is depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-d**. Note that some elements depicted in this figure are also described in **39.5 - Output and validation** and **39.6 - Building scenarios**.

The output and validation library, described throughout **39.5 - Output and validation**, is depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-c**. Note that this is distinct from **!fig:output-full**, which includes various virtual machine outputs due to their role in the chapter's discussion.

Finally, modules related to scenario construction, as described in **39.6 - Building scenarios**, are depicted in **!fig:architecture-full-a**.
