- Synthesizers are not to be italicized. Every mention of a synthesizer in a paragraph not focusing on that synthesizer should have a citation.

- Bulleted lists should have their key element **bolded** where applicable.
- Tools or libraries may be `monospace` to distinguish them from regular text. Use this sparingly; tools with "actual names" should have no formatting applied. (for example: `uv`, `dfvfs`, the Digital Forensics Virtual Filesystem, Pydantic, CASE, `caselib`)
- Italicization *for emphasis* is allowed. Bolding for emphasis is not.
- Italicization for "proper" terms, such as the names of modules, is allowed but should be limited in usage.
