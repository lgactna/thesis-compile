What class was this used in, and elements of the class are worth mentioning? What was the scenario we gave students? What was the context provided to students about the dataset (for example, were they told this was a synthetic dataset? if so, what were they told about it being synthetic?)?

# 7.2 - Student analysis

How well were students able to analyze the scenario? If there were specific items that we expected students to find, how many of these items were identified in the reports that students created?

- *Extreme* stretch goal - this only covers the student side of things. What about the instructor side of things? Do they think AKF covers their use cases, and is it as easy to use as I claim it is?
- Wouldn't it be great to have a full ransomware incident response scenario, where all of network, memory, and disk images are relevant, and there's more than one machine involved, and there's a bunch of "typical" user files that get encrypted? wouldn't that be great ???

# 7.3 - Findings and observations

 Were there other things of note, like the students noticing traces of AKF being left behind? Did students like the alternative scenario compared to an existing, human-crafted scenario? What did students like or dislike?
