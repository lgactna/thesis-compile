The complete implementation of AKF is available on GitHub at the following locations:

- Core libraries (`akflib`): [https://github.com/lgactna/akflib](https://github.com/lgactna/akflib)
- The AKF agent for Windows (`akf_windows`): [https://github.com/lgactna/akf-windows](https://github.com/lgactna/akf-windows)
- Standalone CASE/UCO 2.0 bindings for Python (`caselib`): [https://github.com/lgactna/CASE-pydantic](https://github.com/lgactna/CASE-pydantic)

The `akf_windows` repository contains a sample declarative script utilizing every implemented declarative module, demonstrating nearly all existing AKF functionality. It also contains an equivalent imperative script that was generated using `akf-translate`. Both scripts, and some of their outputs, can be found in the `./scenarios` folder.

# Comparison of ForTrace and AKF agents

Invoking commands in ForTrace [@gobelForTraceHolisticForensic2022] is straightforward; at the network level, commands are performed by issuing a simple string to the agent running on the target VM. For example, invoking a command to add a new user to the VM can be seen in **!lst:b.2.a**:

```python
!lst:b.2.a|Creating a new user through ForTrace agent commands
# From Demo.py
guest = virtual_machine_monitor1.create_guest(guest_name=imagename, platform="windows")

# Wait for the VM to connect to the VMM
guest.waitTillAgentIsConnected()
# create userManagement object
userManagement_obj = guest.application("userManagement", {})

# Add different users
logger.info("Adding user1")
try:
    userManagement_obj.addUser("user1", "password")
    while userManagement_obj.is_busy is True:
        time.sleep(1)
except Exception as e:
    print("An error occured: ")
    print(e)
time.sleep(5)
```

The agent's main loop, which receives and interprets these commands, is also straightforward. A simplified version of the main loop is depicted in **!lst:b.2.b**:

```python
!lst:b.2.b|Simplified ForTrace agent entry point
def main():
    # create logger
    logger = create_logger('guestAgent', logging.INFO)

    logger.info("create Agent")
    a = Agent(operating_system=platform.system().lower(), logger=logger)
    logger.info("connect to fortrace controller: %s:%i" % (fortrace_CONTROLLER_IP, fortrace_CONTROLLER_PORT))
    a.connect(fortrace_CONTROLLER_IP, fortrace_CONTROLLER_PORT)

    # let all network interfaces come up
    time.sleep(15)

    # inform fortrace controller about network configuration
    a.register()

    # wait for commands
    while 1:
        time.sleep(1)
        a.receiveCommands()
```

When the `Agent` is instantiated, it binds a TCP socket to the configured port and IP address, where it expects the server (the VMM) to issue commands. `Agent.receiveCommands()` executes commands by reading the socket, parsing the received content, and then invoking `Agent.do_command()`, which converts the command message into a specific Python function call with arguments.

The server, or "virtual machine monitor" (VMM), issues commands over TCP to a running instance of the agent on the VM. Each module under `fortrace.application` can be thought of as a coherent group of commands associated with a particular user application (such as Firefox or Thunderbird). Recall from **!lst:b.2.a** how we found our `userManagement` application and invoked `addUser`; a simplified snippet is depicted in **!lst:b.2.c**:

```python
!lst:b.2.c|Minimal ForTrace application API usage
userManagement_obj = guest.application("userManagement", {})
userManagement_obj.addUser("user1", "password")
```

At a high level, the `application()` call attempts to import `fortrace.application.{application_name}`. Although not enforced by a higher-level interface, each of these modules contains subclasses of the following four classes (defined in `fortrace.application.application`) at minimum, with additional helper classes for OS-specific functionality or other modularity as needed:

- `ApplicationVmmSide`: Contains one function for each command implemented in `ApplicationGuestSide`. Each function builds a message that will be interpreted and acted upon by the corresponding `ApplicationGuestSideCommands` class.
- `ApplicationVmmSideCommands`: Accepts and interprets module-specific messages returned by the agent, which may be used to update the remote state as tracked by the host.
- `ApplicationGuestSide`: Implements the actual application-specific functionality for the agent, providing one function for each available command.
- `ApplicationGuestSideCommands`: Interprets commands and arguments, calling the respective function in the corresponding `ApplicationGuestSide` subclass. This allows the actual dispatch of commands to be delegated to this class, which is free to choose how actions are performed (such as the use of threading and multiprocessing) as well as any module-wide state it may need to maintain.

This naming convention is intentional, as individual modules dictate the name of the module in camelcase. For example, `fortrace.application.userManagement` contains `UserManagementVmmSide`, `UserManagementVmmSideCommands`, and so on. Discovering and getting handles to these classes is performed through string manipulation of the relevant application's module name, as shown in **!lst:b.2.d** (an abridged version of the `Agent.do_command()` method):

```python
!lst:b.2.d|Demonstration of ForTrace agent module discovery and command execution
def do_command(self, command):
	com = command.split(" ")
	package = com[0]
	module = com[1]

	# load class moduleGuestSide and moduleGuestSideCommands
	name = "fortrace." + package + "." + module
	self.logger.debug("module to load: " + name)
	mod = __import__(name, fromlist=[''])
	self.logger.debug("module '" + module + "' will be loaded via __import__")
	class_commands = getattr(mod, module[0].upper() + module[1:] + 'GuestSideCommands')
	
	class_commands.commands(self, app_obj, " ".join(com[1:]))
```

In the example above, `UserManagementGuestSide.addUser()` contains the code to execute on the guest when `addUser()` is called, such as adding the registry keys needed for a user to be created. On the other hand, `UserManagementVmmSide.addUser()` contains the code to send a message over TCP that the agent will understand, eventually leading to the execution of the agent's version of `addUser()`. 

More precisely, the `ApplicationVmmSide` subclass effectively serves as the API for calling the associated functions in the `ApplicationGuestSide` class running on the virtual machine. This subclass, along with the complete agent-side code, is stored in a single file. For example, the API and code for opening a Firefox browser window can be seen in **!lst:b.2.e**:

```python
!lst:b.2.e|Sample ForTrace agent API implementation
class WebBrowserFirefoxVmmSide(ApplicationVmmSide):
    def open(self, url):
        """Sends a command to open a webBrowserFirefox on the associated guest.

        @param url: Website to open.
        """
        try:
            self.logger.info("function: WebBrowserFirefoxVmmSide::open")
            self.url = url
            self.window_id = self.guest_obj.current_window_id
            self.guest_obj.send(
                "application " + "webBrowserFirefox " + str(self.window_id) + " open " + self.webBrowserFirefox + " " + self.url)

            self.guest_obj.current_window_id += 1
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception("error WebBrowserFirefoxVmmSide::open: " + str(e))

# Example usage:
browser = WebBrowserFirefoxVmmSide()
browser.open("google.com")
```

Calling the `open()` command from the host sends a structured message to the agent, generally of the form seen in **!lst:b.2.f**: 

```
!lst:b.2.f|Sample ForTrace agent protocol message
application webBrowserFirefox <window id> open Firefox <url>
```

Upon receiving this message, the agent's main loop will search for the `webBrowserFirefox` module and import its corresponding `ApplicationGuestSideCommands` subclass. After any state management, the subclass will then search for a function called `open` in its corresponding `ApplicationGuestSide` class, as implemented in **!lst:b.2.g**:

```python
!lst:b.2.g|Corresponding ForTrace agent-side call 
class WebBrowserFirefoxGuestSide(ApplicationGuestSide):
    def open(self, args):
	    # docstring omitted
        try:
            arguments = args.split(" ")
            web_browser = arguments[0]
            url = arguments[1]

            if len(arguments) > 2:
                self.timeout = arguments[2]
            else:
                self.timeout = 30

            self.logger.info(self.module_name + "GuestSide::open")
            self.last_driven_url = url
            self.logger.debug("URL to call: " + url)

            self.logger.info("open url: " + url)

            self.helper.run_firefox()  # start ff session

            retval = self.helper.navigate_to_url(url)  # browse to the specified url
            if not retval:
                self.logger.warning("could not open url")

            self.agent_object.send("application " + self.module_name + " " + str(self.window_id) + " opened")

            self.agent_object.send("application " + self.module_name + " " + str(self.window_id) + " ready")
            self.window_is_crushed = False
        except Exception as e:
            # Some logging/teardown...
            self.window_is_crushed = True
            self.agent_object.send("application " + self.module_name + " " + str(self.window_id) + " error")
```

As described in **39.4 - Action automation#4.2.2 - The AKF agent**, this is achieved in AKF using RPyC services, which are analogous to the `ApplicationGuestSideCommands` and `ApplicationGuestSide` classes of individual ForTrace modules. In addition to providing the RPyC services themselves, agents also implement an API to call these services using typed functions. 

For example, suppose we wanted to implement functionality similar to the ForTrace code above, allowing users to navigate to a webpage. An equivalent RPyC service and its corresponding API may be implemented as seen in **!lst:b.2.h**:

```python
!lst:b.2.h|Minimal reimplementation of ForTrace module as an RPyC service
# Server-side code
class ChromiumService(AKFService):
	def exposed_set_browser(
        self, browser_type: Literal["msedge", "chrome"], profile: str = "Default"
    ) -> BrowserContext:
        # Various setup code...
        self.browser = chromium.launch_persistent_context(
            headless=False,
            user_data_dir=profile_path,
            channel=browser_type,
            args=[f"--profile-directory={profile}"],
        )

        return self.browser

# Client-side API
class ChromiumServiceAPI(WindowsServiceAPI):
    def __init__(self, host: str, port: int) -> None:
        """
        Initialize the API with an RPyC connection to the service.
        """
		self.rpyc_conn = rpyc.connect(
			host,
			port,
			config={"sync_request_timeout": None},
		)

    def set_browser(
        self, browser_type: Literal["msedge", "chrome"], profile: str = "Default"
    ) -> BrowserContext:
		self.browser = self.rpyc_conn.root.set_browser(browser_type, profile)
        return self.browser
```

Implementing support for a particular service on the client-side API is as simple as calling an untyped function `rpyc_conn.root.set_browser()`. By wrapping it around a typed function, `ChromiumServiceAPI.set_browser()`, users regain the ability to use code completion and static linting tools. 

# CASE Python bindings

As described in **39.5 - Output and validation#5.2.1 - CASE and Python bindings**, CASE is defined using Turtle, allowing objects to be written in a human-readable text format. For example, the following set of triples in **!lst:b.3.a** describes an object called `ApplicationFacet` with two properties, `numberOfLaunches` and `applicationIdentifier`:

```turtle
!lst:b.3.a|Example CASE object definition for applications [@UcoProjectUCO2025]
observable:ApplicationFacet
	a
		owl:Class ,
		sh:NodeShape
		;
	rdfs:subClassOf core:Facet ;
	rdfs:label "ApplicationFacet"@en ;
	rdfs:comment "An application facet is a grouping of characteristics unique to a particular software program designed for end users."@en ;
	sh:property
		[
			sh:datatype xsd:integer ;
			sh:maxCount "1"^^xsd:integer ;
			sh:nodeKind sh:Literal ;
			sh:path observable:numberOfLaunches ;
		] ,
		[
			sh:datatype xsd:string ;
			sh:maxCount "1"^^xsd:integer ;
			sh:nodeKind sh:Literal ;
			sh:path observable:applicationIdentifier ;
		] ,
		...
		;
	sh:targetClass observable:ApplicationFacet ;
	.
```

An instance of an `Application` object may thus be represented in the JSON-LD format using the `ApplicationFacet` as seen in **!lst:b.3.b**, including some attributes omitted from the example in **!lst:b.3.a**:

```json
!lst:b.3.b|Instantiated CASE application object as JSON-LD 
{
	"@id": "kb:dcec8d09-a8bc-4b7c-93ab-16c7b363d48b",
	"@type": "uco-observable:Application",
	"uco-core:hasFacet": [
		{
			"@id": "kb:68004de9-1139-405f-aea7-2c05f3a84709",
			"@type": "uco-observable:ApplicationFacet",
			"uco-observable:numberOfLaunches": 12,
			"uco-observable:applicationIdentifier": "test"
		},
	]
}
```

The CASE project provides official Python bindings [@CaseworkCASEMappingPython]. One notable implementation detail is that it stores all object attributes in a dictionary after instantiation. This can be seen in the example of an `ApplicationFacet` in **!lst:b.3.c** below. Intuitive usage suggests that the `application_identifier` attribute is accessible through the `facet` object, but it must instead be accessed as a dictionary key with a non-intuitive name.

```python
!lst:b.3.c|Sample usage of official CASE Python bindings [@CaseworkCASEMappingPython]
facet = ApplicationFacet(application_identifier = "test", number_of_launches=3)

# These attributes do not exist
facet.application_identifier
facet.number_of_launches

# The number of launches must be accessed as a dictionary key, which
# does not return a simple integer; instead, it returns a
# dictionary
app_facet['uco-observable:numberOfLaunches']
# -> {"@type": "xsd:integer", "@value": "3"}
```

AKF's Pydantic-based bindings greatly simplify the declaration of individual CASE objects while allowing typical attribute-based access. For example, AKF's complete declaration of `ApplicationFacet` is shown in **!lst:b.3.d**:

```python
!lst:b.3.d|Example of Pydantic-based CASE object declaration used by AKF
from typing import Optional

from uco import core

# ... Other object definitions in same file

class ApplicationFacet(core.Facet):
    installedVersionHistory: ApplicationVersion | list[ApplicationVersion] | None = []
    operatingSystem: ObservableObject | None = Field(
        default=None, json_schema_extra={"IRI": True}
    )
    numberOfLaunches: int | None = None
    applicationIdentifier: str | None = None
    version: str | None = None

```

This definition is only eight lines, which is 27 lines shorter than the declaration of `ApplicationFacet` provided by the CASE project's existing Python bindings (excluding the docstring). 

A simple CASE bundle, representing the complete contents of a forensic scenario, can be constructed and exported to JSON-LD using AKF libraries as shown in **!lst:b.3.e**:

```python
!lst:b.3.e|Demonstration of bundle serialization using the AKF Python bindings for CASE
from caselib import case, uco

bundle = uco.core.Bundle(
    description="An Example Case File",
    specVersion="UCO/CASE 2.0",
    tag="Sample artifacts",
)

url_object = uco.observable.ObservableObject()
url_facet = uco.observable.URLFacet(fullValue="www.docker.com/howto")
url_object.hasFacet.append(url_facet)
bundle.object.append(url_object)

with open("example.jsonld", "wt+") as f:
    data = bundle.model_dump(serialize_as_any=True)
    f.write(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```

Although the UCO/CASE 2.0 Python bindings developed as part of AKF significantly improve usability and flexibility over the existing CASE bindings, several limitations of the library do not make it fully compliant with the CASE ontology. In particular, the Python bindings aim to keep object definitions as simple as possible, preferring native Python types where possible. This means that some information from the ontology is lost when converting them to their respective Python class. Several examples include:

- **Datatypes**: Many XSD datatypes are not equivalent between the turtle files and Python bindings. For example, the arbitrary-precision `xsd:decimal` type is represented as a native Python float, but is also written out as a native JSON float on serialization to JSON-LD. The resulting datatype is `xsd:float`, which may cause information to be lost.
- **Vocabularies**: Many CASE "vocabularies", a datatype in which a field's value should be chosen from a fixed set of values, are correctly converted to native Python string enumerations. However, the vocabulary datatype is not serialized, only the value; thus, the resulting JSON-LD makes no indication that the selected value is actually from the vocabulary datatype, even if the value itself is inside the vocabulary set. For example, if the string "MD5" is a member of the `HashNameVocab` datatype, our Python bindings serialize this as a standard `xsd:string`, not `vocabulary:HashNameVocab`.
- **Field names**: Some fields of CASE objects, such as the `from` field of an email message, are reserved Python keywords that may not be used as the name of a variable. To solve this, we append an underscore to any fields that would violate this rule when automatically generating Pydantic classes from the Turtle RDF files. However, the original name of the field is not preserved when serializing objects; although the simplest fix is to remove trailing underscores when serializing, a more robust solution may be to attach the "original" name to the Pydantic field.
- **Dangling references**: There are no built-in mechanisms to ensure that an object is serialized in its "full" form at least once; that is, a user could place references to an object identifier throughout the document without adding the object being referred to. 

Additionally, one major feature of CASE/UCO is not currently supported. CASE allows objects to be of multiple types at once, such as a disk image marked as both an `observable:File` and an `observable:Image`. Python types can inherit from multiple types, but a single object may not be multiple types at once; it might be necessary to create a "wrapper" type that encompasses both types and correctly serializes these types as expected.

# Historical declarative syntaxes

While designing the declarative syntax for AKF, the syntaxes of D-FET [@williamCloudbasedDigitalForensics2011], SFX [@russellForensicImageDescription2012], and Yannikos et al. [@yannikosDataCorporaDigital2014] were reviewed. For completeness, brief examples of scenarios in each of these synthesizers are included here. Notably, none of these works provide details on how the parser of their declarative languages is implemented. Similarly, few details are provided about the architecture and design of the code used to carry out actions based on interpreted declarative instructions. This lack of detail may be attributed to the fact that the scenario creation enabled by these declarative syntaxes, rather than the syntaxes themselves, was the primary focus of these works. 

**D-FET** [@williamCloudbasedDigitalForensics2011] uses a custom language that does not depend on any existing text-based languages, as seen in the simple scenario in **!lst:b.4.a**:

```
!lst:b.4.a|Sample D-FET declarative scenario without events [@williamCloudbasedDigitalForensics2011]
INSTANCE LOAD [Image=WINDOWS2003] 
MOUNT INSTANCE [Disk=STANDARDDISK] AS [Partition="c"] 
ACTIVITY LOAD [Number=12] [Type=JPEG IMAGES; Class=DRUGS] 
	INTO [Folder=USER FOLDER] 
	AT [Period=1 MINUTE] [Interval=INTERVAL] 
	FOR [User=Fred]
```

The scenario above will create an instance based on the WINDOWS2003 image from the Host Forensics Image library (which contains pre-created images from OS installation discs). It will then load 12 JPEG images from the "DRUGS" class of images using the "STANDARDDISK" disk image. This appears to create a host with *predefined*, but not *timed* activity – the machine simply begins in this state rather than simulating a user doing this over some period of time.

To generate timed activity that can be placed on a timeline, D-FET allows users to add "events." The sequence of events in **!lst:b.4.b** directs the synthesizer to log in as a user, delete files, and log out.

```
!lst:b.4.b|Extension of the D-FET declarative scenario with events [@williamCloudbasedDigitalForensics2011]
INSTANCE LOAD [Image=WINDOWS2003] 
MOUNT INSTANCE [Disk=STANDARDDISK] AS [Partition="c"] 
ACTIVITY LOAD [Number=12] [Type=JPEG IMAGES; Class=DRUGS] 
	INTO [Folder=USER FOLDER] 
	AT [Period=1 MINUTE] [Interval=INTERVAL] 
	FOR [User=Fred]
ACTIVITY EVENT [Event=LOGIN; User=Fred] 
ACTIVITY EVENT [Event=DELETEFILE; User=Fred; File=JPEF IMAGES] 
ACTIVITY EVENT [Event=LOGOUT; User=Fred ]
```

**SFX** [@russellForensicImageDescription2012] uses an XML-based language with tags and attributes that are easily readable , as shown in **!lst:b.4.c**:

```xml
!lst:b.4.c|Sample SFX declarative scenario expressed as XML [@russellForensicImageDescription2012]
<disk size="512M" alignment="cylinder" diskid="0x12345678">
	<partition index="p1" hidden="0" size="48M" type="vfat">
		<expand archive="part1.zip" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/fake01.dat" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/fake02.dat" />
		<delete from="/Thomas.jpg" />
	</partition>
	<partition index="p2" hidden="0" size="48M" type="ntfs">
		<base os="windows7x64" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/fake03.dat" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/fake04.dat" />
		<user username="Gordon">
			<browserhistory browser="firefox">
				<url link="[http://bbc.co.uk"](http://bbc.co.uk") time="13:14:00 1 Jan 2013" />
			</browserhistory>
		</user>
	</partition>
	<partition index="p3" hidden="1" size="64M" type="ntfs">
		<expand archive="part3.zip" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/fake11.dat" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/fake12.dat" />
		<delete from="/docs/image.exe" />
		<slackspace offset="20" file="/tomas.gif" message="This is a secret message" />
	</partition>
	<partition index="s1" hidden="0" size="144M" type="ext3">
		<base os="fedora15x64" />
		<expand archive="part2.tar" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/tmp/fake01.dat" />
		<copy from="fake.dat" to="/tmp/fake02.dat" />
	</partition>
</disk>
```

Here, a user can define multiple partitions on a single disk, each with a distinct filesystem that may or may not contain an underlying operating system. SFX allows users to generate artifacts in multiple ways, with each unique application- or OS-specific feature using a distinct XML element name. Artifact generation features include copying files to the guest machine in bulk, inserting files in the slack space of an existing file, and using browser artifacts. 

Finally, the work of Yannikos et al. [@yannikosDataCorporaDigital2014] is particularly notable because it appears to be fully GUI-based, expecting users to visually construct Markov chains to define scenarios. An example scenario from their publication can be seen in Figure **!fig:yannikos-gui**:

![GUI-based scenario declaration from Yannikos et al. [@yannikosDataCorporaDigital2014]](yannikos.png){#fig:yannikos-gui}

Although details are relatively limited, each node appears to be a distinct action that can be automated. Individual nodes accept parameters that can be used to configure how their associated artifacts are created. Each "box" encompasses a complete Markov chain, with transitions from one box to another occurring after an unknown condition is fulfilled. Finally, the diamonds outside the boxes, known as extensions, are libraries that provide extra functionality during the execution of the overall scenario.
